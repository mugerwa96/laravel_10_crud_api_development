##LARAVEL 10 API DEVELOPMENT 
Laravel is a PHP framework developed with developer productivity in mind. <br>
Written and maintained by Taylor Otwell, the framework is very opinionated and strives to save developer time by favoring convention over configuration.<br>
The framework also aims to evolve with the web and has already incorporated several new features and ideas in the web development worldâ€”such as job queues, API authentication out of the box, real-time communication, and much more.
